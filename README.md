# Piano

Simple browser piano demo.

- Open `index.html` in a browser to play.
- Keys in the UI map to audio files in `notes/`.

Notes
- Audio samples are included in `notes/` and may make the repo large. Consider using `.gitignore` and `git lfs` for large files if you plan to add more.

Suggested commands
```powershell
cd 'C:\Users\mamta\OneDrive\Desktop\piano'
# Stage, commit, and push
git add README.md
git commit -m "Add README.md"
git push
```

If you want, I can add a `.gitignore`, enable Git LFS for `notes/`, or open the repo on GitHub.
